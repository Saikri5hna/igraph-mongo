igraph-mongo
============
The folder 'graph_input' contains the java code used to create random values.

The R code folder has the R code to connect and query from mongoDB, convert 
from BSON to Data Frame and the code to create network graph.

The igraph webslinks folder contains the resources that helped me in the process. 

The 'images' folder contains the final graphs.
